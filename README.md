# Backend Coding Challenge

Thanks so much for your interest in working at [Lufthansa Innovation Hub](https://lh-innovationhub.de/) as a [Senior backend developer](https://weworkremotely.com/remote-jobs/lufthansa-innovation-hub-senior-backend-developer-ruby)! Below is a challenge we'd like to have you do. The primary purpose of this is to understand how you solve engineering challenges.

**You should spend no more than 1 hour on this project.** 

## üîê The challenge

We are building a mini app to list airports. The UI is ready, but we need to build the backend.

Your challenge is to:

- Create and seed the database
- Seed airports and check that the number reported is correct using Rails console
- Write required routes + endpoint that returns airports
- Add params to return airports only for specific countries
- Build pagination using [`Pagy`](https://ddnexus.github.io/pagy/how-to#quick-start&gsc.tab=0)
- There are lots of non-relevant (small) airports, make sure the most relevant airports are returned first. Required data is already in the model.
- Add specs to test what you normally would in such an app

We want to build an app by Rails standards with specs. Database search must be fast even if there would be millions of airports.

## üß† Assumptions

- Airport model already exists together with code for seeding airports
- Front-end exists, it will use airports endpoint and also provides `countries` parameter

## üì¶ Deliverables

As an asynchronous company, this test project will be done asynchronously. **You may submit your challenge response in text or video, or a mix of the two.** Video is the preferred method.

Ultimately, it's more important for us to understand your thought process and why you make the decisions you do versus the format you use. Whatever format helps you convey your solution to the challenge is fine with us.

**Reply to your job application email thread with your solution to the challenge and we'll go from there!**

## Getting Started

The app is designed to work out of the box with no external dependencies, other than gems and Node modules.

```shell
bundle install
yarn install
```

## Running locally

### Frontend

```
./bin/webpack-dev-server
```
### Backend
```shell
rails s
```

Once started, the app should be available via http://localhost:3000
